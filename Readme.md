# Exercises found at the end of the handmade city talk by Ryan Fluery

* I'd highly recommend the talk. You can find it [here](https://vimeo.com/handmadecities?fl=pl&fe=by).

I think I could do most of this as part of my [compiler project](https://github.com/Cijin/zinter). It makes sense and would handle exercise 6 too.
I'm thinking of doing it on stream too. Should be fun.
